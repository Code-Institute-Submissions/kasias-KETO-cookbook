        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
            A keto or ketogenic diet is a low-carb, moderate protein, higher-fat diet that can help you burn fat more effectively. It has many benefits for weight loss, health, and performance, as shown in over 50 studies. That’s why it’s
            recommended by so many doctors. A keto diet can be especially useful for losing excess body fat without hunger and for improving type 2 diabetes.

        <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">
            What’s the most important thing to do to reach ketosis? Avoid eating too many carbs. You’ll likely need to keep carb intake under 50 grams of net carbs per day, ideally below 20 grams. The fewer the carbs, the more effective the
            diet appears to be for reaching ketosis, losing weight or improving type 2 diabetes. Counting carbs can be helpful at first. But if you stick to our recommended foods and recipes you can stay keto even without counting.

                    <h4>Why Keto worked for Stacey</h4>
                    <p>
                        My biggest challenge I’ve faced was getting through the detoxing stage right when I started keto. But I had to power through it because I knew I had to change my life and commit to eating healthy. Since starting keto
                        my life has changed in every imaginable way possible. I’m a completely different person now. I am truly happy with my body image. I don’t hide myself anymore. I let my light shine. This was the BEST thing that I
                        could have ever done for myself. It has changed the way I look at nutrition, and I have a very healthy relationship with food now. I hope you enjoy reading my story!

        Preheat the oven to 350°F then line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

        In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment (or a large bowl
        using a hand mixer) combine coconut oil and coconut sugar. Mix on high
        for 1 minute then add vanilla extract and almond milk. Continue to mix
        for another 30 seconds.

        With the mixer running add the almond flour first. Next add the oat
        flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Continue to mix for about
        20 seconds, until a dough forms. Using a spatula, scrape down the sides
        and bottom of the bowl in between mixing to assure all of the
        ingredients are combined. If the dough appears dry and crumbly, try
        allowing it to mix for longer. If it’s still crumbly, try adding a
        tablespoon of milk. Stir in the chocolate chips at the end with a
        spatula.

        Using a scooper or a spoon, scoop out about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of
        dough at a time. Arrange them on the baking sheet with about 2 inches in
        between each. Bake in the oven for 12-13 minutes, until edges are light
        golden brown. Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. They
        will continue to firm up as they cool.

    <h4>Tips</h4>

    <p class="font-italic">
      Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
    </p>

    <p class="font-italic">
      You can also freeze the balls before baking and bake from frozen when
      ready to eat them.
    </p>

    <p class="font-italic">
      *If your coconut oil is rock solid, microwave it (without the lid) for 10
      seconds, or until just soft enough to scoop. If it starts to get
      liquid-like then you will have to refrigerate until solid again. It’s very
      important that coconut oil is solid for the recipe to work properly. Vegan
      butter will work in place of coconut oil but the texture is softer with
      coconut oil. You can also use a combo of both, if you prefer.
    </p>

    <p class="font-italic">
      **Be sure to use certified gluten-free oat flour for allergies.
